# Azure API Management service changelog

Developer portal follows an independent release lifecycle and the [per-release changelog is available on GitHub](https://aka.ms/apimdevportal/releases).

## Release - API Management service: January, 2021

A regular Azure API Management service update was started on January 21, 2021, and included the following new features and bug fixes, along other improvements. It may take several weeks for your API Management service to receive the update.

### New

1. You can now use the `cache-response` attribute in the `cache-store` policy to specify when to cache the outgoing HTTP response. For example, `<cache-store cache-response="@{return true}" />` will cache all API responses. If the `cache-response` attribute isn't specified, only HTTP responses with the status code `200 OK` will be cached. Documentation will be updated soon.
1. You can now view service summary, explore service recommendations, and access additional resources in the redesigned overview page in the Azure portal.

1. You can now use the `isKeyVaultRefreshFailed=true` query parameter in the list certificates by service and list named values by service API calls in the API version 2020-06-01 or later to find the entities, for which the refresh from Azure Key Vault action failed. Documentation will be updated soon.
1. You can now monitor connectivity to Azure Key Vault using the network status endpoint in the API version 2020-06-01-preview or later.

### Fixed

1. We fixed an error, which could cause named values and certificates stored in Azure Key Vault to not be refreshed.

## Release - API Management service: December, 2020

A regular Azure API Management service update was started on December 7, 2020, and included the following new features and bug fixes, along other improvements. It may take several weeks for your API Management service to receive the update.

1. You can now log [API inspector traces](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-api-inspector#trace-a-call) to Application Insights and Azure Monitor by setting the `verbosity` property of [the `service/diagnostics` resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/templates/microsoft.apimanagement/service/diagnostics) to `debug`. Azure portal interface for this feature will be released in early 2021.
1. You can now mask or hide sensitive query parameters and headers in diagnostic logs. The `hide` setting will remove an entity, while `mask` setting will replace it with the word "hidden". Refer to [the `service/diagnostics` API endpoint documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/apimanagement/2020-06-01-preview/diagnostic/createorupdate#datamasking) for more details. Azure portal interface for this feature will be released in early 2021.
1. You can now monitor database connectivity in secondary regions in the `Network Status` page in the Azure portal as well as via the respective API call, if your API Management service is deployed in multiple regions.
1. [New management API version `2020-06-01-preview`](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/apimanagement/) is now available for testing.

### Fixed

1. Elements of collections in responses from the `Content Types` and `Content Items` management API endpoints no longer overlap between pages.

## Release - API Management service: October, 2020

A regular Azure API Management service update was started on October 21, 2020, and included the following new features and bug fixes, along other improvements. It may take several weeks for your API Management service to receive the update.

### New

1. You can now create Developer, Basic, Standard, or Premium API Management services in the Brazil Southeast region.
1. `xml-to-json` policy supports two new parameters for handling empty values and trimming string values:

    ```xml
    <xml-to-json empty-values="preserve|asNull" trim="true|false" />
    ```

1. `context.Request.Body` and `context.Response.Body` support three new methods:
    
    ```csharp
    JToken AsJToken(bool preserveContent = false, JsonSerializerSettings settings = null);
    JObject AsJObject(bool preserveContent = false, JsonSerializerSettings settings = null);
    JArray AsJArray(bool preserveContent = false, JsonSerializerSettings settings = null);
    ```

1. Liquid templates in the `<set-body>` policy now support accessing JObject and JArray variables, for example: `context.Variables.contoso.property` or `context.Variables.contosoarray[0].property`.
1. `validate-jwt` policy now supports JWE tokens compressed with the [default algorithm](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516#section-4.1.3).
1. `Network Status` API now returns status for the Azure Active Directory endpoint.
1. `Named Values` API now supports filtering by ID.

### Fixed

1. Developer portal session is now correctly persisted in case of redirects to other websites. Previously, the session could have been lost when using sign-in delegation or redirecting to websites from e-mail notifications.
1. Developer portal now supports additional OAuth parameters for acquiring access tokens, which enables integration with external identity providers, like Auth0.
1. API Management now correctly handles wildcard OpenAPI parameters, such as `/sample-operation/{*rest}`.
1. We fixed several bugs, which could result in inaccurate `Network Status` API responses.
1. We fixed a bug, where API Management stored incorrect payload in the cache if a request contained conditional headers `If-Modified-Since` or `If-None-Match` and cache entry didn't exist.

### Changed

1. The [`Connection` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Connection) is no longer forwarded from the backend to the client.
