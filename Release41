## Release - API Management service: November, 2023

### New features, improvements, and changes
 
- We will now provide specifics about token validation failures in `validate-azure-ad-token` policy in API Inspector.
- We made the password policy stronger for users creating accounts on the developer portal - e.g., it now requires using a special character. Complete password requirements will be shown on the sign-up page.
- Users now must provide their current password before changing it on the developer portal.
- Pagination controls on the developer portal now feature only the Next and Previous buttons.
 
### Fixes
 
- We fixed an issue that caused tokens of logged-out developer portal users signed in via Azure AD B2C to remain valid under some circumstances.
- We fixed a regression that caused POST requests issued from the try it console on the developer portal not to work correctly.
- We fixed an issue in the Content Access Control feature of the developer portal that allowed unauthorized access to pages via direct link.
